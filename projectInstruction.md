Final Project – Machine Learning and Statistics in Medical Applications
General Information

The project will be completed in pairs.

You must select a medical dataset and perform an analysis using the tools and methods learned throughout the course.
You may use a publicly available dataset or a dataset that you collected independently.

The goal of the project is to apply machine learning and statistical methods to a real medical problem.

The project consists of two stages.

Stage 1 – In-Class Presentation

You are required to present your project in class.

The presentation must include:

General background of the topic

Research question

Description of the methods

Description of the dataset

Preliminary results

Future directions / planned extensions

Duration:
5–7 minutes (maximum 10 minutes).

All group members must participate in the presentation.

Stage 2 – Full Written Submission (PDF in English)

You must submit a written report structured like a scientific paper.

Maximum length: 8 pages.

The report must include the following sections:

Abstract

A concise summary including:

Background

Research question

Main results

Conclusion

Introduction

A literature review and theoretical background relevant to your research topic.

Methods

A detailed description of:

Data preprocessing

Algorithms used

Statistical tests performed

Feature selection methods (if applicable)

Filtering criteria

Normalization techniques

Train / Validation / Test split

Evaluation methods

There is no need to explain general theory, only what was specifically implemented in your project.

Results

Presentation of findings using:

Tables

Figures

Visualizations

Model comparisons

All claims must be supported by quantitative results.

Discussion

A section including:

Conclusions

Limitations

Possible improvements

Future research directions

Technical Requirements

A GitHub repository must be provided.

A clear and organized README file must be included.

The code must be executable.

The full analysis notebook may be submitted separately (not as part of the 8-page report).

Important: The submission must not be purely descriptive.
The project must include quantitative analysis.

Content Expectations

Your grade will be based on the scientific depth and analytical quality of your work.

You are expected to demonstrate:

Understanding of the dataset (distribution, characteristics, challenges)

Clear explanation of preprocessing steps

Justification for model selection

Use of appropriate evaluation metrics (Accuracy, AUC, Recall, Precision, F1, R², Correlation, etc.)

Statistical comparison of models (if applicable)

Error analysis (e.g., Confusion Matrix)

Discussion of overfitting

Evaluation of generalization

Consideration of dataset and model limitations

The project should reflect critical thinking, not just model execution.

Bonus (Optional)

Up to 10 bonus points may be awarded for:

Use of advanced methods (e.g., CNN, GCN, Genetic Algorithms)

Explainability analysis

Deeper analytical insights

Integration of multiple data sources

Creativity and innovation

Formatting Requirements

Clear section headings

Numbered figures and tables

Figure captions

Academic writing style

Grading Breakdown

Stage 1 (Presentation) – 30%

Stage 2 (Final Paper) – 70%

Deadline

The submission deadline for Stage 2 is final.
No extensions will be granted.

In Summary

Your project should demonstrate:

Statistical understanding

Proper application of machine learning

Medical insight

Critical thinking

Academic organization
